            <p>Worked in an outsourcing company for many years. Developed client projects,
                Did features for different CMS. Mostly layout, ready to pass all the experience
                to you. Having worked with hundreds of projects, I learned how to get out of even the most
                hopeless situations. Will help you master the layout so that it ceases
                ...so it won't seem like something to be afraid of.</p>
